# memory-game

Name : Curious George Memory Game

Description: This is a memory matching game. Click on the cards to reveal their picture and try to match all the cards. When you get a wrong match you get 1.5secs to remember where it was before they flip back over. When you match all 6 pairs you win, but if you guess wrong 5 times you lose.

Technologies: JavaScript, CSS, HTML

Next Steps: I want to create a difficulity option that will add more cards and adjust the wrong guess amount. Even further I'd like to create more themes in one app.
